IN this project I will try to build a RAG system at leas from stratch on medical dataset. 

I will be using pubmed dataset and I will try to deploy a model in production setting using limited ressources.

We will be using the following elements: 


- https://huggingface.co/michiyasunaga/BioLinkBERT-large:  As language model to use to learn embedding for both question and paragraphs
- https://huggingface.co/datasets/pubmed_qa/viewer/pqa_unlabeled?row=0: the dataset to use as it contains the questions and the paragraphs..
- for the generative model to use to generate answers will be : https://github.com/stanford-crfm/BioMedLM


This is not a research paper is it an engineer implementation, of an ML system to see if things will work in Production...
